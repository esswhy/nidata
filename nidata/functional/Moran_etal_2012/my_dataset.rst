Moran et al. 2012 results


Notes
-----
Results from an fMRI study that investigated the activation of brain
regions in three social cognition tasks between younger and older adults.
Younger adults show higher activation in the dorsal medial prefrontal
cortex across all three tasks, including more activation in the
superior temporal sulcus and medial temporal lobe.
